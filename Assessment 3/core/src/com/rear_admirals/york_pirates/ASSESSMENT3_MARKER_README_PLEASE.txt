3. On our github repository (https://github.com/PurePixel/3.14Rates) there is a branch called:
    "Original-Copy-DO-NOT-DELETE-OR-CHANGE"
which is a copy of the project as we received it from the other team. Therefore you can also see our changes by
comparing that branch against master using git.

4. As well as adding code we did also make some minor formatting changes where we started working on a file and tidied
it up to make our lives easier. For instance we may have added/removed whitespace or added variables to break up long
lines of:
    objectFoo.objectBar.objectX.getZ().objectZ.myMethod();
We have decided not to add comments for these since they were only created where we happened to be working and found
the code too messy. It also does not change any of the functionality whatsoever.
